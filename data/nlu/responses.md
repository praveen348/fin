The Sweep-In facility links the deposits you choose, and whenever there are insufficient funds in your Account to clear a cheque, we will break units of the deposit to clear the cheque. Here's an example of how it works: Let's say you have a Sweep-In facility on your Savings Account with a linked Fixed Deposit of Rs10,000/-. If you have just issued a cheque for Rs. 4000/-, but the balance in that Savings Account is Rs. 1000/-, HDFC Bank will mark a lien on the Fixed Deposit to the extent of Rs. 3000/- (4000/- less 1000/-) and clear the cheque.

A child rarely has an income and therefore has no reason to be insured. If the Insurance Plan is taken in name of the child, the plan gets derailed in case of the unfortunate demise of the parent. Thus, the very objective of any Children�s Plan is undermined if the plan is acquired in the child�s name. Therefore, as far as possible, make sure that you, as a parent, are the Life Assured and the nominee or the beneficiary is your child.

  - A large part of the success of Mutual Funds is also the advantages they offer in terms of diversification, professional management and liquidity. Power of Compounding: The longer the period of your investment, the more wealth you can accumulate because of the power of compounding. That�s why it makes sense to start investing early. Quite simply, the incremental returns that you earn on your principal, plus accrued gains, is compounded. Rupee Cost Averaging: Most investors want to buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high. But timing the market is time consuming and risky. A more successful investment strategy is to adopt a method called Rupee Cost Averaging. By investing in an SIP you end up buying more units when the price is low and less when the price is high. To set up an SIP, walk in to your nearest HDFC Bank branch or invest through an Investment Services Account. View more

  - The current scenario in the equity market is dominated by negative sentiment, which has led to fundamentals being ignored. This scenario has created volatility in the markets and uncertainty of future outlook. The prudent way to invest in this scenario is to benefit from the volatility and this can be done by investing through SIP�s. A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors. Such volatility makes it difficult to capture the market movements and most people end up losing money with the intention of timing the markets. Also investing a lump sum in one shot might lead you to miss out on market opportunities. The tool to beat such a scenario is investing through a Systematic Investment Plan.
